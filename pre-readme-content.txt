# awesome-startups

This repo is maintained to provide the information regarding the Top 100 startups across the globe. To retrieve the awesome-data about the awesome-startups, I have used the rankings provided by `startupranking.com`. The PHP-script crunches the latest data on daily-basis to provide [up-to-date information](#how-it-is-dynamic) in this README file. It also provides a list of country-based startups(sorted in descending order of the no of startups in a country) while the startups in their corresponding files are listed in ascending order of their rankings.
